# kaon-interactive-project

The platform is divided into three main screens:
- Entry Screen: This is the first screen that the user will be see.
- Inner 1 Screen: This screen is located to the left of the entry screen.
- Inner 2 Screen: This screen is located to the right of the entry screen.

To navigate through each screen, there are arrows on each side that correspond to specific actions:
- Button 1 moves to Inner 2 Screen.
- Button 2 moves to Inner 1 Screen.
- Button 3 and Button 4 move to the Entry Screen.

// The HTML and CSS code for this project is organized in sections corresponding to the three main screens to make the code more readable.
// I have also included smooth element interactions in each section to enhance the user experience and make the project more engaging.
